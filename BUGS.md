# Cannon Fodder Original Engine Bugs
  
Issues in the original engine which have been fixed  (unfortunately this list is not complete, as some bugs got fixed and forgotten)
  
* The second and third squad grenade and rocket count did not refresh after using either weapon.
* If the mouse was kept in the sidebar while changing squads, the camera pan would get stuck
* Out of bounds memory access. Numerous places in the original read past either the end of an array, or the beginning of one
